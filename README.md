Amazon Product Performance Dashboard

This dashboard analyzes Amazon product performance using customer ratings, pricing data, discounts, and review volume. 
The goal is to identify top-performing products, understand the relationship between price and customer satisfaction, and evaluate category-level performance.

Key Insights
Products with higher review counts provide more reliable ratings, making weighted average ratings a better performance metric.
There is no strong positive correlation between higher discounts and higher ratings, indicating that discounts alone do not guarantee better customer satisfaction.
Certain product categories consistently outperform others in both average rating and review volume.
Product popularity is measured using total review counts as a proxy for user engagement due to the absence of user-level identifiers.

Tools & Techniques
Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualization
Weighted average ratings to account for review volume
Slicers for category, rating range, and price range analysis
